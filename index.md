## Monday July 17th, 2017
* Learning how the web server works with Node.js
* `express()` is used to export express module
* path : This is the file path that is being sent.
* `app.listen` Binds and listens for connections on the specified host and port.
* `app.use` Mounts the specified middleware function or functions at the specified path: the middleware function is executed when the base of the requested path matches path. 
* `app.get()` Routes **HTTP GET requests** to the specified path with the specified callback functions.
* `res` object represents the **HTTP response** that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request.
* `req` object represents the **HTTP request**.
* `express.static()`Creates a new middleware function to serve files from within a given root directory. The file to serve will be determined by combining req.url with the provided root directory.
* Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
* Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
    * Execute any code.
    * Make changes to the request and the response objects.
    * End the request-response cycle.
    * Call the next middleware function in the stack.
    * If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

## Tuesday July 18th, 2017
* `res.json` sends a JSON response to the parameter that is converted to a JSON string
* `app.post` routes **HTTP POST requests** to the specified path with the specified callback functions
* To handle HTTP POST request in Express.js, we installed a middleware module called body-parser.
* The `bodyParser.json` which parses or extracts the text or body of an incoming request as JSON and exposes the resulting object on req.body
* `bodyParser.urlencoded()`: Parses the body as URL encoded data (which is how browsers tend to send form data from regular forms set to POST) and exposes the resulting object (containing the keys and values) on req.body. This parser accepts only UTF-8 encoding of the body.

## Wednesday July 19th, 2017

* Started a new project called [kodedLand](https://github.com/Dubby20/kodedLand) which is a forum app where users can create a profile, add posts, comment and like other users post.
* Designed the UI using v4-alpha bootstrap and font awesome framework

## Tuesday July 25th, 2017
* Continued with our forum app project
* The app starts on express server and listens on port 4000 for connections
* Installed `ejs` template to render view engine to be dynamic. `ejs` lets a user generate HTML markup with plain Javascript

## Wednesday July 26th, 2017
* Added some features to our forum app
* Used `ejs` to create an "if" statement to show profile data when the user is logged In or show login form when the user is logged out
* Created a folder (views) to render the "addPost" view engine
* Installed and connected MongoDB/Mongoose: a schema-based solution to model application data which can be saved and retrieved
    * Created a file name postSchema inside the model folder
    * Defined the user's post schema in a file(postSchema) which we exported to the router using `module.exports`
* Query mongoose using `mongoose.Promise` property to execute queries from the mongoose database.
* Queries are then returned as promises which have a `.then()` function. For a fully-fledged promise, we used the `.exec()` function
* Also `callback` or `async` can be passed to a query in Mongoose and returned as `.find()` and `.save()` respectively.
* Used `.trim()` method to remove white space from both end of a string in the user's title and content
* Used `.replace()` method to match and replace `(/[,\s+]/)`(regular expression) in the user's body tags
* Installed `moment.js` to parse, validate, manipulate and display user's dates and times.

## Thursday July 27th, 2017
Did a recap of the forum app with the team in class

## Friday July 28th, 2017
* Started working on a new Portfolio website


## Saturday July 29th, 2017
* Methods of Selecting Elements:
    * **document.getElementById**: It takes a string argument and returns the one element with a matching Id
    * **document.getElementsByClassName**: It takes a string argument and returns a list of elements that have a matching class
    * **document.getElementsByTagName**: It returns a list of all elements of a given tag name like `<li>` or `<h1>`
    * **document.querySelector**: It returns  the first element that matches a given CSS-style selector
    * **document.querySelectorAll**: It returns a list of elements that matches a given CSS-style selector

## Sunday July 30th, 2017
* DOM Manipulation of text or html using: 
    * `.classList`: Its a read-only property which returns all the class attributes in a given element. Methods includes: `.add()`, `.remove()`, `.toggle()`
    * `textContent`: Returns a string of all text contained in a given element
    * `innerHTML`: Returns a string of all the HTML contained in a given element.
* How to use `getAttributes()` and `setAttributes()` to read and write attributes like `src` or `href`. `setAttributes()` takes two arguments, the first is the name of the attributes e.g `href` while the second is what you want to change it to.
