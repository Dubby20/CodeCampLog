## Monday July 17th, 2017
* Learning how the web server works with Node.js
* `express()` is used to export express module
* path : This is the file path that is being sent.
* `app.listen` Binds and listens for connections on the specified host and port.
* `app.use` Mounts the specified middleware function or functions at the specified path: the middleware function is executed when the base of the requested path matches path. 
* `app.get()` Routes **HTTP GET requests** to the specified path with the specified callback functions.
* `res` object represents the **HTTP response** that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request.
* `req` object represents the **HTTP request**.
* `express.static()`Creates a new middleware function to serve files from within a given root directory. The file to serve will be determined by combining req.url with the provided root directory.
* Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
* Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
    * Execute any code.
    * Make changes to the request and the response objects.
    * End the request-response cycle.
    * Call the next middleware function in the stack.
    * If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

## Tuesday July 18th, 2017
* `res.json` sends a JSON response to the parameter that is converted to a JSON string
* `app.post` routes **HTTP POST requests** to the specified path with the specified callback functions
* To handle HTTP POST request in Express.js, we installed a middleware module called body-parser.
* The `bodyParser.json` which parses or extracts the text or body of an incoming request as JSON and exposes the resulting object on req.body
* `bodyParser.urlencoded()`: Parses the body as URL encoded data (which is how browsers tend to send form data from regular forms set to POST) and exposes the resulting object (containing the keys and values) on req.body. This parser accepts only UTF-8 encoding of the body.

## Tuesday July 25th, 2017
* Continued with our forum app project

* Installed `ejs` template to render view engine to be dynamic. `ejs` lets a user generate HTML markup with plain Javascript

## Wednesday July 26th, 2017

* Used `ejs` to create an "if" statement to show profile data when the user is logged In or show login form when the user is logged out
* Created a folder (views) to render the "addPost" view engine
* Installed and connected MongoDB/Mongoose: a schema-based solution to model application data which can be saved and retrieved
    * Created a file name postSchema inside the model folder
    * Defined the user's post schema in a file(postSchema) which we exported to the router using `module.exports`
* Mongoose is a mongoDB object modelling tool designed to work in an asyncchronous environment.
* Query mongoose using `mongoose.Promise` property to execute queries from the mongoose database.
* Queries are then returned as promises which have a `.then()` function. For a fully-fledged promise, we used the `.exec()` function
* Also `callback` or `async` can be passed to a query in Mongoose and returned as `.find()` and `.save()` respectively.
* Used `.trim()` method to remove white space from both end of a string in the user's title and content
* Used `.replace()` method to match and replace `(/[,\s+]/)`(regular expression) in the user's body tags
* Installed `moment.js` to parse, validate, manipulate and display user's dates and times.

    * **document.getElementsByTagName**: It returns a list of all elements of a given tag name like `<li>` or `<h1>`
    * **document.querySelector**: It returns  the first element that matches a given CSS-style selector
    * **document.querySelectorAll**: It returns a list of elements that matches a given CSS-style selector

## Sunday July 30th, 2017
* DOM Manipulation of text or html using: 
    * `.classList`: Its a read-only property which returns all the class attributes in a given element. Methods includes: `.add()`, `.remove()`, `.toggle()`
    * `textContent`: Returns a string of all text contained in a given element
    * `innerHTML`: Returns a string of all the HTML contained in a given element.

* Documents can be retrieved through `find`, `findOne` and `findById` and these can be executed on Models
    * `.find` can be used to retrieve only certain fields
    * `.findOne` only receives a single document as second parameter
    * `.findById` same as `.findOne`, but receives a value to search a document by their `_id` key
    * `.count` counts the number of document matching `conditions`
    * `.remove` removes document matching `conditions`
    * `.distinct` finds distinct values of `field` for document matching `conditions`
    * `.where` creates query your model
    * `.$where` to query Javascript expression e.g `User.&where('this.firstname === this.lastname').exec(callback)`
    * `.update` to update all documents matching conditions
* `mongoose.connect` is used to connect your app to only **one** database while `mongoose.createConnection` is used to create additional connections

## Wednesday August 2nd, 2017
* An Introduction to React: 
     * React is a descriptive, efficient and flexible Javascript library for building user interfaces. it writes app as components.
    `React.component` class takes in parameters called `props` and returns views to display via the `render` method 
    * Components are class and functions. Class maintains **state** but function cannot.
    * State management in react is done at the component level i.e a way to store data 
    * Every React component has a `render()` and must `return` something
    * `.props` is used to pass data from parents component to child element
    * `setState` can be called with a function or an object
    * When mapping an array it is important to give a unique key to the items
    * Reacts observe and update state when anything changes

* Built an interactive tic-tac-toe game in class
    * The tic-tac-toe comprises of three components: (a) Square (b) Board (c) Game. The Square component renders a single `<button>`, the Board renders 9 squares, and the Game component renders a board with some placeholders.

## Friday August 11th, 2017
* On the Book: **"You Don't Know Js** -
    * In *Number* JS Types `toFixed()` method allows you to specify how many fractional decimal places you'd like the value to be represented with.
        * `toPrecision()` is similar but specifies how many significant digits should be used to represent the value.
        * The output is a string representation of number.
        * `Number.isInteger()` is used to test for integers
        * `Number.isSafeInteger()` is used to test if a value is a safe integer
        * `Number.isNaN()` to test if `NaN` is a number
    * `Object.is()` is used to test two values for absolute equality.
* Had a seminar @StoneBricks on the topic *Entrepreneurship*. Key Points:
    * Determinants 
    * Benefits: Be clear on the benefit your product provides. Your product should have real values.
    * Target Market: Know your customers.
    * Competiton: What makes you have an edge over your Competitors?
        * Cost leadership means you provide reasonable value at a lower price.
        * Differentiation literally means Innovation. This means you meet the same needs in a new way.
        * Focus means you understand and service you target market better than anyone else.
* **Food for thought:** What is my Unique Selling Proposition (USP)? To be successful, you need to be able to articulate the benefit you provide to your target market.
